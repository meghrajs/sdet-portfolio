# SDET Portfolio — Meghraj Singh

I build reliable test automation and quality systems across UI + API layers, with a focus on CI/CD, debuggability, and stable releases.

## Core Strengths
- UI Automation: Playwright / Cypress / Selenium
- API Testing: REST validation, negative scenarios, data-driven coverage
- CI/CD: pipelines, artifacts, repeatable runs, containerized execution
- Reliability: flaky-test reduction, retries strategy, observability (logs/traces/screenshots)
